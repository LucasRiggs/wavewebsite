						For seven months I was involved as part of the team at M&S  in Sutton station. This involved preparing the in-store bakery, stocking, manning the tills and making coffee for early morning passengers.

						<p class="paragraphs">
						For a month I worked in London within a summer camp which involved guiding foreign non-English speaking teenagers from the ages of 12-17, either guiding them through London or planning evening activities. Similar to scouting activities these could both be physical but also many academic activities which were primarily to aid in English speaking skills. Activities were often thought up by us  activity leaders which helped develop intuitive methods towards managing students
